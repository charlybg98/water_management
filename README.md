# Water Stress Analysis in Mexico Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project employs machine learning to analyze and predict water stress in Mexico, a critical issue for sustainable water management in the region. We integrate diverse datasets, including historical precipitation, water storage in dams, renewable water estimates, aquifer levels, water usage, and quality metrics, among others. The objective is to identify key factors contributing to water stress and provide predictive insights for informed decision-making in water governance.

## Methodology and Goals
Our approach begins with feature selection using methods like LASSO or Elastic Net to identify significant predictors. We then develop and compare various predictive models, including logistic regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, aiming to understand and forecast water stress levels. The project emphasizes practical recommendations for water management, backed by rigorous data analysis and scenario planning using advanced machine learning techniques.
